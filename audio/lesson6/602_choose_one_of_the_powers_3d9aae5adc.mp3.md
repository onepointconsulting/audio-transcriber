## Transcription:

Choose one of the powers, perhaps one you would like to experience more deeply.

Sit comfortably. We're going on a journey.

Take a deep breath, one that fills your lungs completely. Hold it for a moment, and then exhale, breathing out tension.

Inhale and breathe in peace.

Breathe out stress.

Breathe in peace.

Breathe out tension.

Now let your attention rest on your toes and feel them relax. And as your toes relax, let your attention wander to your feet and then your ankles. You feel them relaxing, and they are soft and comfortable and relaxed.

Now the feeling spreads to your calves and thighs, and your muscles let go and relax completely.

You rest your attention lightly on your stomach, and then your chest. And as they relax, the feeling spreads to your shoulders. Your body feels good. And now your arms let go, and your hands are curled softly with no tension. Face and neck relax.

And your jaw and scalp relax. Your whole body is relaxed and comfortable, and you feel the relief of unwinding.

Now you are free to travel. You turn your thoughts inward and go deep inside.

With every breath you take, you go deeper. Below the day-to-day responses of your life, below the emotions and reactions to life, to a place of deepest silence.

You can see yourself clearly, the truth of you.

Energy, separate and unique.

Remember the power you would like to experience more deeply. Turn the power in your mind and examine it.

How would you use it?

And if you did, in what way would it change your relationships?

Perhaps change your life.

When you are ready, bring your consciousness back to the world.

The power comes with you.
