## Transcription:

I practice to keep myself internalized.

From this position, I observe my thoughts.

My thoughts come from my feelings and emotions.

They come from deep within, from my subconscious.

And my mind creates thoughts in response to what I see and hear.

My mind creates so many different thoughts.

In soul consciousness, I focus my mind on truth, and I ensure real, pure, true thoughts are created.

Sometimes a waste thought appears on the screen of my mind, extraneous and reactive to some event or person. I watch that thought and make it disappear.

I tell my mind, "Oh mind, stay pure. Stay peaceful. Stay detached. Be focused on what is real and meaningful."

From time to time, something may trigger a bad memory, a doubt, a negative feeling, and a wave of thought, negative thought, tries to come to the surface of my mind.

I look at it, conscious of my original, pure, peaceful, and powerful reality.

And I make that thought calm and quiet.

Let it again merge into the past.

I let go of the past.

I choose to be easy,

light,

accepting,

and to move forward.

I allow everything to be as it is.

I am not disturbed by anything.

Many things may arise.

I look at them through the eyes of wisdom,

and I let them go, so they have no impact on my being. I keep my mind pure and clean.
