## Transcription:

Removing my focus away from the world around me, I turn my attention inwards to meditate on my soul.

As I think about being a soul, I wonder, what is the form of the soul I am?

I have a body made up of the five elements.

I am not my body. I am the life force within my body, the soul.

I am a tiny spark of light.

A point of light.

My body is visible, but I the soul cannot be seen.

I am tiny.

And I am very powerful.

Just as a microchip is small, yet can contain a lot of information, I the soul am the same.

I am a tiny point of powerful energy.

I am moving into soul awareness.

I am remembering who I really am.
