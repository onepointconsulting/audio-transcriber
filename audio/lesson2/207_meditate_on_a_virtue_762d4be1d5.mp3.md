## Transcription:

This meditation will help you to access and activate the virtues within your soul.

Allow your body to become still.

You have all the virtues within your soul. You may not be able to draw upon them in every situation, but you have all the virtues within you.

If you haven't already done so, select a virtue for your meditation. Whichever one you decide upon is the right one for today. So choose your virtue now.

Imagine a tiny ball of light within you. In the middle of your brain, a little spark of energy.

This is the seed of your chosen virtue. The seed is lying dormant, and your attention will activate it.

Think about your virtue.

Focus again on the tiny glowing ball of light in the middle of your brain.

The glow becomes a little brighter, more intense. And the light from the seed starts to spread outwards and fills your brain with light. The seed grows brighter, and the light spreads further, filling your entire head.

You sense the light pouring out of your eyelids. Light pouring out of your ears, out the top of your head, forming an aura of light.

The seed continues to glow, spreading light to your mouth, so the virtue will influence the words you speak. The light glows into your throat, your shoulders, your chest, your heart, your back.

The light spreads to your arms and fingers, so that your actions will be influenced by the virtue.

The light spreads down to the soles of your feet. You are glowing with light, originating from your virtue seed. You are glowing inside.

You are radiating a ball of light all around you. Light and virtue. The light of your virtue.

Filled with light, surrounded by light.

How could you use the virtue in your life? Perhaps there is a specific situation where you could benefit from this virtue guiding your thoughts, your words, your choices, your actions.

It's time to return to your day. Let the memory of your aura of light linger. As you breathe a little more deeply. Very gently move your fingers.

Look for opportunities today to use the virtue you have just activated in your soul.
