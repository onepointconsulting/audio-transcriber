## Transcription:

I turn my attention within so that I can feel the awareness that I have a body, but I am the inner being.

Turning my attention within, I'm able to feel that difference. Being internalized, I can sense that my being is so different from anything physical.

I can feel the quality of peace, that what I am is a being of peace, and I act through the body. I see through the eyes. I hear through the ears. I speak through the mouth.

I am very subtle.

The body is my instrument through which I act. I perceive the material world through my senses.

Being turned within like this, I feel the difference between I, the self, the body, my instrument, and the external world.

When I am turned within, I feel myself as something real, though very subtle and intangible.

I am at peace with myself. I am at peace with the other beings in this world. I am at peace with whatever is going on externally. I am becoming more and more clear who I am.
