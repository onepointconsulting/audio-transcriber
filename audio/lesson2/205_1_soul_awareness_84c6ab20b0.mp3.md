## Transcription:

I turn my attention within, and I feel myself in the center of the forehead as a being of light.

I feel my original qualities.

I am fundamentally at peace. I feel the stillness, the quiet within.

A feeling of deep tranquility.

Inner silence.

I let myself go deeper within. And I begin to feel my original quality of love. A feeling of goodness, benevolence towards myself, to the world, and all people.

My nature is to be loving.

I go deeper, sensing myself peaceful and pure. There is no flaw in the soul. I am like a flawless diamond, absolutely perfect.

And this deep inner purity allows me to know that truly I am powerful. I am an extraordinary energy of being, of spirit. And I begin to realize myself.

And so I feel an extraordinary sense of bliss, very deep happiness that I am me, absolutely pure, still, light, completely loving, and extraordinarily powerful.

It is a wonder to know myself as I really am.
