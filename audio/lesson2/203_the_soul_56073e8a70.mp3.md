## Transcription:

Letting the chair take my weight, I breathe gently in and out.

Breathing in peace, breathing out any stress I may be feeling.

I draw my attention within to consider who I really am.

I am more than just my physical body.

I am a soul and I have a body.

I the soul am the life force in my body.

Within me are all my hopes, dreams, my beliefs and attitudes.

Within me is the recording of everything I have done and thought since I was born.

I have the capacity to love, to be peaceful, to be happy. Sometimes I experience these qualities.

I now focus on my original qualities and allow myself to experience them.

I am peace.

I am love.

I am happy.

Thinking like this allows me to experience these qualities whenever I wish to.
