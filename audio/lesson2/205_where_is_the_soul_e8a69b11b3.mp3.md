## Transcription:

I allow the body to sit quietly. I become aware of the many different energies that make up life. As the body sits quietly, I'm aware of the physical, the biological energies of this valuable instrument of mine. For a little while, I would like to turn my attention away from my physical energies and focus my energy inwards.

Consciously, I allow this physical instrument of mine to let go of the tension in the muscles. My feet, my legs, my back, my arms, my shoulders, my neck, and even the muscles in my face.

I let go of the tension of hanging on, and everything becomes calm and relaxed.

Now, instead of looking outwards, I allow my mind to look within. Seeing the world outside, I choose for a few moments not to see it. I let the sounds of the external world fade into the background so that they are no longer a distraction. And on the screen of my mind, I visualize a point of light.

I can locate this point of light specifically. As the body sits quietly, I become aware of the life force, the source of life, in the center of my forehead, just behind. This is who I am. I am a point of eternal light.

In this awareness of my eternal form, I gather the full force of my energy within. I know I am the master of this physical instrument. I can now direct the way in which my physical senses function. What it is I see through these eyes, what it is I choose to communicate through my lips, even what it is I wish to absorb from the information coming to me through my ears.

I, the being of light, the eternal soul, am the creator. I, this point of infinitesimal energy, am the master.

Becoming aware of this, I am able to send out light and life throughout this physical body and use this body for that which is constructive, that which is filled with goodness.
