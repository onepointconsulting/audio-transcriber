## Transcription:

Sitting quietly, I focus my attention on the soul. I, the eternal being, the being of peace.

In this awareness of peace, I move beyond the limits of my physical body. And in this state of peace, I begin my journey. I dive below the surface of the waves to discover the treasures within.

On the surface are the memories of the immediate experiences of the past. But patiently, I decide for a while not to ponder over these. Not to spend my valuable moments of silence contemplating the memories of sorrow, but to see what there is further down, deeper within.

The waves stay up above, and the silence of my own inner being draws me in towards itself. And as I come to the core of my being, I see that here, at the very heart of my being, there is beauty, there is love.

And I can feel happiness emerging from deep inside. I begin to touch the treasure of joy, knowing that this is my eternal state.

I maintain this inner awareness of happiness.
