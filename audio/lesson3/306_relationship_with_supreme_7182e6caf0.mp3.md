Gently concentrate the mind. Be still. In silence, focusing my thoughts. I reach my home. And in my home, I meet my eternal parent.

My eternal parent, the one who cares, the one who gives me a true life. And in the sweet silence, in this meeting of myself with my eternal parent, I begin to experience what pure relationship is.

The eternal one is my beloved mother, who with great wisdom and patience guides and sustains me. My eternal mother, who accepts me as I am, cleans me, makes me worthy, shows me my worth and my value.

The eternal one, the source of light, is my gentle father, who through love gives me a new life, a new consciousness, a new perspective. The one who directs me towards my goal of realization.

My father, my mother, is also my friend. And all true love has its highest expression in friendship. And in this friendship, I'm not afraid to share my weaknesses, because I understand that my weaknesses will be removed with sweetness and tolerance.

The eternal one is my immortal friend, the one I can rely on, the one whom I trust so deeply that I can open myself completely. And it is in this divine friendship that I'm able not only to find myself, but change myself.

This friendship does not judge or criticize, but reveals to me how to change and constantly inspires me to become better and to emerge the potential within myself. This love of the father, the mother, and friend cleans me.

In this relationship, in this deep link of the heart to the heart of the eternal one, the rays of purity and truth wash away the past, the guilt, the fears, the shame. This love protects and uplifts me.

Now, in the silence of my home, I experience the reality of this eternal relationship. I do not feel alone. I do not feel unwanted. I have a companion, a support. I have a father, a mother, a friend who are helping me to express my uniqueness, my value within this play of life.

Let me remain here with the eternal one, with you, my supreme friend, in the supreme silence, in the supreme light. In your eternal peace, I remain in your presence. And your light and your love constantly flow into my mind and into my heart.

Constantly flow into my mind and into my heart. I have found what I was looking for.
