## Transcription:

I go deep inside myself.

I can feel my being glowing in the center of my forehead.

I am not this body.

My body is physical. I am so different from anything physical.

I am not at all material. I am not my brain.

I am pure consciousness.

And I am forever. I, the soul, am indestructible, immortal.

I have come into this body to play my role. This body is temporary. I came into it.

I use it. I play my part in this material world with other beings. And eventually, I will leave this costume and move on.

And now, I practice to step outside of the awareness of this body. I see myself as a tiny, non-physical star of being.

And really feel the difference between I, the being, and this, my instrument, my vehicle.

I can feel my body just sit quietly.

While I, the being, allow my awareness to float upwards.

With a single thought, I just step out of the consciousness of this body. I am like a tiny rocket. And with the speed of thought, I can carry my awareness beyond the material world, the earth.

I can fly beyond space.

And reach a world of light and silence, the home of souls, where I came from, to which I will return.

I can come to this world of light and silence.

And with a simple thought, I can glide back down, reconnect with my body.

And I feel refreshed for having taken time out.
