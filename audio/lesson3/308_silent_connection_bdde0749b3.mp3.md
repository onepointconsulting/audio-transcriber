## Transcription:

I relax.

And I remember to move inwards, to stabilize in the consciousness of the original self.

I am a point of eternal energy, a point of light, a being of peace. I am a soul.

Peace is my original quality, my original resource.

In peace, I find my inner foundation.

Peace is serenity, a feeling of completeness, of contentment.

Peace is freedom. I go beyond any wasteful thought, any wasteful feeling, and I return to my original foundation.

And I remain quiet, concentrated on this thought: I am a peaceful soul.

I feel the peace and the serenity flow through all my being. I am free.

I am content. I feel stable.

I feel at one with myself.

Peace, contentment, freedom, silence.

Freedom, silence, peace, silence.

And in silence, I connect with the supreme.

In silence, I connect to the one that I can trust.

I connect to the one who is complete love, a love that accepts me as I am, a love that transforms and liberates me.

I can feel the flow, a current of energy coming from the supreme source, deep into my being.

This connection enables me to have the power to make the changes that I wish to make, to remain truly peaceful.
