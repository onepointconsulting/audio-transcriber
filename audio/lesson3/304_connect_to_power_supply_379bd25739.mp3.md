## Transcription:

In silence, I focus gently on the point of energy, which is I, the soul. The point of energy in the center of my forehead. I concentrate my thoughts on my original form. The point of living light.

My form is a tiny point. I shine, I sparkle quietly, invisibly.

I visualize myself as a tiny star of light, radiating light from the center of my forehead.

And I go deeper into concentration.

I know that the more I focus my attention, the more I experience silence and my original power of peace. And as I stabilize my consciousness, as I become completely calm, I am able to gather my thought energy. And within a second, with just one thought, I travel upward. Imagine your thought like a line of unending light, moving upward.

Going beyond this world of time, this world of matter and sound, and coming to a place of stillness.

I see in this world of stillness myself, myself as a tiny golden point of light. Where am I? I have come home again. This is my original home of liberation. But it is not only my home, but the home of all souls. The home where I find my freedom, my purity, and my peace again. I feel light, I feel free. I am myself.

And in this world, in my home, I see another point of pure radiating light. Who is this? What is this? As I come closer and closer, I feel the light of eternal peace. It is the light of eternal wisdom. This is the supreme amongst all souls, the source of life. The one who is eternally pure, the immortal one. This supreme being radiating light like the physical sun, and the rays of peace and love and purity reach me. And as they reach me, I, the soul, feel myself re-energized, renewed. These rays of love and peace give me back to myself.

In my home, in my silent home, let me now remain in this experience of love, of light, and peace. Love, light, and peace. I am linked with the supreme energy. This is the link of life.

Love, light, and peace in my home. I am absorbed in these qualities. Let me remain here.
