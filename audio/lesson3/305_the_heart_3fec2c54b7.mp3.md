## Transcription:

There are times when I feel locked into this material world and unable to let go.

But still, let me focus. Patiently, I draw my attention within, and I remember that I truly am a being of light, a soul.

I am valuable.

Slowly, I am able to disconnect from the pull of the world. I begin to feel peace, waves of love.

Patiently and gently, I am able to move beyond. I have to let go of concerns and worries that are like ropes holding me down.

On the one side, the pull of thoughts of the world, and on the other side, the attraction of peace and love. I have the confidence, the knowing that that one is there for me.

It gives me the strength to let go. Little by little, I let go of those strings, ropes, and chains. They just break in those feelings of quiet, peace, and light.

And then I am free, like a balloon. Nothing prevents me from flying upwards.

All those concerns of the world seem very small and manageable in the light and feelings of love that I receive from the one above.

I allow myself to be carried by that magnet of sweetness.

I keep focused.

In my mind, I begin to speak to that one. You are present for me.

You are my light.

You are always there.

And as I begin to speak, I start to feel the response. I have always been there for you.

I am always with you.

Just remember me, and I am there.

And I say yes, you are there, and I am here. And it puts everything into perspective.

I trust you. You are my support.

You know my future.

You are my guide.

With those words, a relationship is set and begins to grow.

I will never be alone again. And with a feeling of deep happiness, I gently let myself back down again into the everyday world with eyes that see it differently.
