We're about to go on a journey. A journey that enables us to regenerate our powers. We are about to reconnect with the highest source of all beauty, all power, all love.

Imagine that you can see on the screen of your mind a tiny star. You might see or sense this. Either is fine. The star is pure light. Be aware of this star. Tune into this star. Feel the frequency of this tiny point of pure light.

And now simply transfer your awareness, your sense of self across and into that star, into that light. Feel that you have become the light. Pure freedom, eternal energy.

Feel the lightness of being in being just a tiny point. As you easily, naturally and gently sit in the awareness of being pure energy. It's as if an ancient part of you starts to remember, to connect with the source, the beginning.

Tuning in now to this memory as it becomes a powerful ray of pure light, a golden pathway that gently shoots upwards from you, the star, and travels to the source. As you naturally glide with the ease of being light along that pathway of light, you arrive in a world of pure energy. Pure, warm, golden red light, vital, yet so calm. Gently, ever so gently you are pulled to the very core of the source of power.

Diving fully and easily into that source. Resting. Feeling. Allowing. Quiet. Natural.

Floating, floating in the purity of this gentle power, deeply letting go. Allowing. At one. Overflowing energy, light, power.

In a moment we're going to make the return journey, knowing that you can always come back, because this is your memory, your relationship with the source.

And so, effortlessly gathering your awareness, bringing with you the memory and the stillness and the power of the source, travel easily along your golden pathway back to the star on the screen of your mind, bringing with you the peace, clarity, and power of your inward and upward journey. In your own time and when you're ready, become aware of your breathing, your body, the sounds around you. And now bring your conscious awareness back to this room.
