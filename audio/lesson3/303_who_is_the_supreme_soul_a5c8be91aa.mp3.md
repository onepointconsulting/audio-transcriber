## Transcription:

I go deep within.
And I want to know, who is this?
Who is that light?
What is that light?

I have to become very still and quiet.
Move myself deep within, and onto a different level from the everyday world.
I let myself shift into that other world of light, so that I can be with that one.
But who is this?
This is not just an energy, not just a light.

Within that light, there is a someone.
Who is this?
I let myself go close to that light, and I begin to feel the magnetic pull of love.
It is so extraordinary that a tiny light is so vast in radiance.

And the waves of love emerge from that source, and travel across the light space, and go straight into my heart.
It is warm and gentle, sweet and intimate.
The love from that light spreads out and pervades the whole universe.
And the waves come directly to me, and through me.

Behind that love, I sense wisdom.
The all-knowing wisdom of the one who is beyond the game.
I sense that this one knows me totally, much more than I know myself.
Sees the totality of my being, accepts me completely.

This one is offering everything to me: love, protection, support, a promise to be always with me, no matter what.
That promise goes deep into my being like an arrow of light.
And I feel faith and certainty that this one is always for me, always has been, always with me.
It is a promise for all time, a guarantee.

And I take this deep into myself.
It strengthens me and makes me aware of who I am and who we are.
We will always be connected, only a thought away.

And so with lightness and joy, I slip gently back into this body, into the everyday world.
