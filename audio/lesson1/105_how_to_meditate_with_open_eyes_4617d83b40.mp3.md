## Transcription:

Keep your eyes gently open, relaxed, and looking at your meditation image. Let your gaze be soft and directed towards the center of the image, with a still and steady attention, as you feel yourself easily relaxing into stillness, slowing down.

Begin your meditation with this thought: I am looking out through these eyes. And I now turn my attention away from the world around me and start to look within. I want to see what's going on in my inner world and find my peace.

I ask myself, am I calm and peaceful right now?

I want to create a beautiful feeling of peace and tranquility.

I'm coming home to peace.

I'm focusing my attention on myself and becoming more aware of the sort of thoughts I allow my mind to entertain.

I'm choosing thoughts that support me.

I'm choosing to be peaceful.

And as I bring this short meditation to a close, I allow my attention to be drawn back to the meditation image in front of me. I notice how I'm feeling. I notice my surroundings. And I reflect for a moment on how it was for me to meditate with open eyes.

And I prepare to move on into the day.
