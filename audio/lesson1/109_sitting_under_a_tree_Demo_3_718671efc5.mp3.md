## Transcription:

Be very still. And imagine it's a warm summer's day. You are sitting on soft green grass under a tree, leaning your back against the tree.

The tree is supporting your weight. You rest your head against the trunk of the tree. And as you do so, all your worries and concerns seem to just slip away.

You feel calm and relaxed. The sun is shining. It's warm. You are enjoying the shade the tree provides, but you can still see the sun through the branches and the bright green leaves of the tree.

Some of the warm rays from the sun are touching your face. The sky is a perfect shade of blue. There are no clouds.

In front of you is a river, which is flowing gently. The water is clear and pure. You can hear the soft, whooshing sound of the water running in the river. All is well in this scene.

You breathe out all the stress that has accumulated inside, and breathe in the quietness and peace that is around you. As you breathe out the stress and breathe in the peace and quietness of this place, you feel calm and peaceful.

Just as the river is running slowly, so you see any thoughts that come in your mind, but you let them go gently.

You create the thought, I am calm.

I am relaxed.

I am at peace.
