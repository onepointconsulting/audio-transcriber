## Transcription:

Imagine that nothing exists outside this room.

Now imagine that the room itself is empty of any objects. There is nothing to distract you.

Then remove your awareness from your physical body and turn your attention inwards.

Become aware of any thoughts going through your mind.

Become the silent observer of your own thoughts, watching each thought come and then moving on.

Thoughts come and then they pass like clouds in the sky.

As you witness your thoughts in this way, notice how they begin to slow down.

Now focus your attention on the idea of peace and peacefulness. Create the thought: Peace has entered my mind, and my mind is now at peace.

Repeat this thought gently and slowly. Peace has entered my mind, and my mind is now at peace.

Allow this thought to grow, and then gently turn up the volume and the brightness of this thought.

Your mind is now filled with peace, and all tension has gone. There is just peace.

In this moment, it is as if you are peace.

Like water that is fresh, still, and clear, your mind is now calm and still and clear. There is a deep contentment.

Realize this is your most natural state of being. This is your true nature.

Having returned to your natural state of peace, you sit for a moment, enjoying these feelings of calmness and serenity.

With this feeling of total peace, gently return your thoughts, your awareness, to your body, to the chair, to the room around you, to the here and now.
