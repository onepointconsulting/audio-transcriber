## Transcription:

In the center of a dark room, in front of you, a candle, unlit.

Lighting the candle, a flicker, a faint glow spreads and warms you.

It is the light of hope.

You are slowly drawn to its center, and all becomes still.

Gradually, the flame increases, and light begins to surround you. It is the light of love.

The candle flame now growing begins to fill the room. It is the light of peace, and all around is quiet. All around is calm.

The candle light again increases and grows and moves beyond the room, spreading light and love and peace to those who are caught in the darkness of their sorrows and fears. For it is the light of compassion, bringing healing and harmony to the surrounding earth.

## Summary:

This audio file is a guided meditation. It begins with the image of an unlit candle in a dark room. As the candle is lit, it represents hope, drawing the listener into stillness. The flame grows, symbolizing love, and fills the room, representing peace and quiet. The light then expands beyond the room, offering compassion, healing, and harmony to those in darkness, ultimately extending to the surrounding earth.
