## Transcription:

Settle yourself comfortably. Close your eyes and breathe in deeply. And as you breathe out, let go any tension. Continue to breathe deeply in your own time.

In your mind, say your name, and then tell yourself, relax. Feel yourself relaxing and keep breathing naturally.

Again, in your mind, say your name and say, relax. And feel yourself relaxing and letting go.

Keep breathing naturally. Once more, in your mind, say your name and say, relax. And let go even more.

Ask yourself, how am I feeling?

Whatever you're feeling, just notice it. No need to change it or judge it. Just become aware of how you're feeling.

Enjoy this quiet moment, paying attention to yourself. You are visiting your inner world.

Now let's leave this meditation and go back to the world outside you, the world around you. When you're ready to move on into your day, open your eyes.
