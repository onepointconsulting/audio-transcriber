## Transcription:

Space for quietness. Taking just a minute, I sit comfortably, quiet and still.

In the quietness, I watch my mind.

I feel my senses. Gently, I speak to them. For a moment, stop. Just stop. Relax and be calm.

Become free of hearing, seeing, doing. Just stop. Now, I am in peace. I am serene. I am quiet.
