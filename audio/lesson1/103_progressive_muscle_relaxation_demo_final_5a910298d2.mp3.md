## Transcription:

Sit comfortably in your chosen meditation place. Close your eyes for a moment. Allow your body and your mind to slow down, simply by remaining still and quiet.

Take three long, deep breaths. Watch your breath. The in-breath, the out-breath. The in-breath and the out-breath.

While keeping your eyes closed, take your attention down to your toes. Clench them tightly for a moment, and then relax them. Do this twice more.

Then consciously relax the muscles in your toes. Work progressively but slowly up through your body, tensing and releasing and relaxing your calves, your thighs, your buttocks, stomach, chest, and arms.

Then focus on your shoulders, your back, then down to your forearms and your hands.

So now your whole body is relaxed. And then bring your attention to your face. Relax your jaw, your eyebrows, and your forehead.

Now simply be aware of your whole body relaxed in the chair.

Bring your awareness back to the room and back to the here and now.
