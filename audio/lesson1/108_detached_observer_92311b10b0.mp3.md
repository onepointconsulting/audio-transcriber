In practicing the stage of the detached observer, the first step is to allow the body to relax. I'll guide you to take three deep breaths, and as you exhale each time, exhale fully and completely. So take your first deep breath, hold for a little, and then slowly breathe out. As you do, relax your shoulders, letting them drop completely, and breathing normally again now.

A second deep breath. Hold. And now release all the breath. And as you do, relax the muscles around your jaw, letting go absolutely and completely. And return to normal breathing.

And now a final deep breath, holding, releasing, and relaxing all the muscles around your eyes, and return to normal breathing.

In this state of relaxation, the second step is to become aware of the external surroundings. The support of the chair, the floor under your feet, my voice and the music, the sounds you can hear outside the room, sounds inside the room, the temperature of the air on your skin. Now, if you hear noises during this meditation, this is normal. The world outside will continue, and all we're doing is turning our attention inwards.

For the third step, now become aware of your inner world. Ask yourself, what am I thinking? Now, don't think these thoughts, just observe them.

And now, what am I feeling?

Knowing what you're thinking and feeling, the fourth step is simply to accept. Accept all the things that you're aware of. Just accept. Let them be. Don't try and change them, fix them, or control them. Don't judge or even analyze them. That's a task for another time perhaps. This time is for finding an inner space of stillness and rest. And so, just accept.

Then if I accept my thoughts and my feelings, then the question becomes, who am I? This brings us to the fifth and final step. I am the observer. I am the one who is watching, the eternal witness, detached yet involved, unaffected and free. While the world goes on outside my body, and even inside my psyche and personality, I, the true one, remain detached, calm, and clear.

Experiencing this observer stage, gently become aware of the outer world again. The chair, the sounds. And when you're ready, simply open your eyes if they're closed, and coming into action now slowly and comfortably. Be aware of how long you can maintain the observer stage as you move about your life.

## Summary:
