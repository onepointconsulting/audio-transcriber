## Transcription:

I move deep within my being, quietening myself.

I allow my sense of self to be focused in the center of my forehead.

I am withdrawn from the physical organs, going deeper, deeper within, to a beautiful place of inner silence.

In the stillness, it's as if I shift naturally into a completely different dimension.

I arrive in an environment of light.

Only light all around.

Bright and still.

Glowing golden.

It is completely still.

Completely away from the world we know.

Just radiant, silent light all around.

This is the world of souls. This is where we came from, and we will return to this quiet place of light.

Within this region of light, there is a vast constellation of tiny beings of light.

Each one unique.

Each one still.

It is a place beyond time.

Completely still.

Completely pure.

Beautiful and sweet.

I the soul am refreshed and restored.

This is the sweet home of light. I can come here whenever I want.

And then gently, I return back to the everyday world, refreshed and restored.
