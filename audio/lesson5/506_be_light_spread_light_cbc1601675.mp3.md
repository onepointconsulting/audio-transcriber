## Transcription:

I am now detached from the physical world around me, and simply observing.

I consciously create only the purest thoughts.

I am a subtle being of pure light.

I become aware of my subtle body of pure white light, surrounding my physical form.

The light of my subtle form is like that of an angel, radiating out into the world.

Each thought is like a fine strand of silk, shimmering into the world around me.

Each strand is a thought, so subtle, so fine, powerful, pure.

Each strand carries a vibration of pure peace.

A gift to any being that it may touch.

In this pure awareness of myself in my form of light, I realize that the greatest gifts I can share with those around me are the light of love,

the light of peace,

the light of truth.
