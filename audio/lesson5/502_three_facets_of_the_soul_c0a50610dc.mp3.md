## Transcription:

I draw my attention within, so that I can consider deeply what exactly is myself, my soul. This tiny point of light energy that is myself is so subtle.

I the self am seated in the center of the forehead, connected to this body through some very subtle energy. I connect with the brain. I think. I feel. I sense.

I have thoughts. I think about myself. I feel myself. And I have thoughts and feelings about what's going on in the world around me.

My thoughts, my feelings, these are my mind. I can think in words or pictures. I can feel positive, negative, different qualities. All these thoughts are within I the soul. And that is called the mind.

I keep on producing thoughts and feelings. Through my senses, I receive impressions, and I think about them. I think about my thoughts to understand them. This power of understanding is also part of I the soul, the intellect.

My conscience is in this part of the soul. Through this, I detect whether things are good or bad, useful or useless. The intellect and the mind work together continuously.

There is behind that my individual personality. What makes me different from any other soul. My nature, my character, my personal attitudes, my talents, my memories, my weaknesses. All these are in myself the soul. My subconscious.

So I watch my mind, and my intellect, and my subconscious, seeing how they operate. I look at the choices I make, and gradually I understand myself a little better. I practice to be detached from my own thinking and feeling, to evaluate myself, and slowly come to know myself more deeply.
