## Transcription:

Withdraw your attention from everything around you. Bring yourself back to a point of self-awareness and soul consciousness.

Now explore the faculties of your consciousness to see how they work together. Create a simple thought in your mind. Just one thought.

Now focus on that thought. Concentrate on that thought.

And then use your intellect to assess the quality of that thought.

Is it negative or positive?

Is it right or is it wrong? Discern the quality of that thought.

Is that thought a waste of your energy?

Is that thought a necessary thought?

And then decide, if the thought is not a good thought, drop it, or consciously destroy it, and then create a better thought.

In this way, you consciously exercise full control over your mind and your intellect.
