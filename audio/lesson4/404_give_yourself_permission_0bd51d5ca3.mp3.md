## Transcription:

Visualize yourself as the soul, a tiny spark of life energy, sitting in the front of the brain, in the center of the forehead.

Just feel yourself stepping back, letting go, withdrawing to this sweet point in the center of the forehead.

Feel yourself sitting so lightly.

And through the eye of your mind, visualize a radiant jewel of light.

See this jewel of light emanating this gentle energy.

Just hold this image in your mind.

And gently begin to move towards this light.

This is the ocean of love, an unlimited source of what my heart desires.

This connection is the union with the supreme soul, an unlimited ocean of pure love.

Just feel yourself relax and open.

And give yourself permission to be completely loved.
