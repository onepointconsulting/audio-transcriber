## Transcription:

I visualize myself as the tiny soul.

A tiny spark of radiant life energy in the center of the forehead.

I feel myself gently withdrawing from the awareness of my body.

Withdrawing and letting go. Stepping back.

I sit so lightly in my forehead.

And in this state of soul awareness, I see a radiant jewel of light through the eye of my mind.

I feel this pure light emanating and filling me with such sweet feelings of pure love.

Let me open myself to this pure love.

The ocean of pure love.

I feel this love washing me.

Filling me. Healing me.

I keep my focus towards this light.

And allow myself to be completely loved.

This love is the love that gives me the courage to change myself.

This love fills me with inner strength.

This love reconnects me to my self-respect.
