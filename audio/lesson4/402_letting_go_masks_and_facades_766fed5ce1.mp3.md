## Transcription:

Let me sit very calmly and quietly. And very gently bring the focus of my mind to the point in the center of the forehead.

To regain my self-respect, let me go deep within to understand who I am.

As I travel internally, I begin to recognize masks and facades I've created to deal with the world outside.

But I begin to dismantle them, to let them go.

To discover the core of my being.

And find a me that is so lovable. My original self is pure, is clean, is unadulterated. This is the part of me that is truly lovable.

The part which I can really value.

I don't have to prove who I am.

This feeling of self-respect is true freedom.

And when I taste the feelings of my own self-respect, I begin to express it in my life.

I feel comfortable with difference.

I naturally express respect for others in all situations in my life.
