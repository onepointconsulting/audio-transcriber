## Transcription:

Let me sit very calmly and quietly.

And gently reflect on my inner world.

Of all the gifts I can give myself, the most precious is self-respect.

When I step into my self-respect, everything in life becomes easy.

How do I feel about myself? Deep, deep down, how do I treat myself?

Do I value who I am?

Do I appreciate who I am?

To regain my self-respect, I travel deeply within to discover who I am.

Along the way, I've collected some baggage.

But I let that go.

And appreciate the real authentic me.

I see myself as the soul.

And know and appreciate and love the real me.

When I connect with this authentic me, all my beauty emerges.

And a very sweet feeling of regaining a real connection with my true self.

This is like coming home to a place where I really belong.

This is the real me. And a deep and sweet feeling of well-being emanates all through me.

When I create the sweet feelings of soul awareness,

I feel so comfortable about who I am.

I feel good about myself.
